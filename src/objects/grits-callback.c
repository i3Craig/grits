 * @short_description: Custom callback objects
 *
 * #GritsCallback objects are used for custom drawing functions. A common example
 * of this would be to render something which does not easily fit into a normal
 * object. For instance, a Heads-Up-Display overlay.
 *
 * Callbacks are an alternate to extending GritsObject with a new class and
 * should be used when only once instance of the object will be needed.
