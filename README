Grits is a Virtual Globe library developed along side AWeather, but desigend to
be usable by other program as well.

This repo is a clone of http://pileus.org/grits/files/grits-0.8.1.tar.gz

November 2024 - Updated ground level rendering so that the state borders don't look like they are floating in the sky.

It is differentiated from other Virtual Globes such as Google Earth, NASA World
Wind, and KDE Marble in that it is developed primairily as a library that is
used by other programs, rather than providing it's own user interface.
